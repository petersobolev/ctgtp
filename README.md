<p>I strongly recommend to run it only on real hardware (Vectrex). It runs under emulator (Vide) however. 

<p>If you don't have Vectrex, check out Youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTPVrLIXqXg

<p>Emulators - invaluable tool for development (thank you, Malban!) but quite bad for everything else.
